        Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their
        experience, strength and hope with each other that they may
        solve their common problem and help others to recover from
        alcoholism.

        The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
        There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting
        through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with
        any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does
        not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor
        opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and
        help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
