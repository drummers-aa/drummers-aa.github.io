       <li>If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed
        before we are half way through.</li>
        <li>We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.</li>
        <li>We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.</li>
        <li>We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace.</li>
        <li>No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience
        can benefit others.</li>
        <li>That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.</li>
        <li>We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.</li>
        <li>Self-seeking will slip away.</li>
        <li>Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.</li>
        <li>Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us.</li>
        <li>We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.</li>
        <li>We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for
        ourselves.</li>
    </ol>

    Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us -
        sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.
